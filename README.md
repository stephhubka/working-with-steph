<h1 align="left">Working with Steph 👋</h1>

✨ **The quick version**
- I care deeply about clarity, quality, momentum — and taste (yes, visuals 🤤)
- The sooner I'm looped in, the better. I love being part of the early idea stage, not just the final draft
- I'm direct, thoughtful, always open to discussion, and I use humor as a coping mechanism 😅
- Async > endless meetings whenever possible
- If you send me a novel in Slack / Teams, my brain might short-circut
- I'm juggling a chaotic life outside of work, so grace + clarity go a long way

👩‍🎨 **Designer origin story**

 I heart systems, strong opinions loosely held, and making complicated things feel obvious. I care a lot about bulding things that are scalable, implementable, and durable — not just polished. If there's ambuguity, I'm probably already building a framework or design solution for it. #sorrynotsorry

🧠 **How I work best**

I'ma mix of strategist + builder:

- zoomed out: vision, product direction, system alignment
- zoomed in: workflows, edge cases, UI details, polish

I move fast once things click, and I do my best thinking with space to focus (most times after I put my son to bed for the night).

💬 **Communication style**

- slack is great for quick pings
- docs / threads are best for nuanced topics
- work-in-progress is always welcome — you don't need to over-polish before sharing

If something feels unclear, I'll ask questions rather than assume.

🤝 **Collaboration with me**

You'll get the best experience working with me if you:

- bring me in early (not just at the finish line)
- share constraints, context, and technical tradeoffs
- workshop ideas out loud
- challenge directions when needed
- share the problem we're solving
- what decision is needed

---

📅 **Meetings & focus**

I love collaborative, purposeful meetings — but I'm also very focus-driven.

- lots of context-switching can be draining
- fewer, cleare meetings > many recurring ones
- async follow-up helps decisions stick

One thing that can be a stressor: last-minute "urgent" meetings slapped on my calendar. Your urgency might be real — but it may not match what I'm prioritizing or juggling in that moment. A quick Slack ping first (with the ask + context) goes a long way.

...unless you're Ben Metz 😅

🌿 **A little more human context**

My partner is a first responder, which means I'm often solo-parenting part of the time while also balancing a demanding role. So alongside work, I'm usually managing:

- school dropoff + pick-up + fetching snacks
- coaching + sick days + doctors appointments
- home life + the invisible to-do list

I also have ADD, and it's genuinely one of my creative superpowers. I'm fast-moving, intuitive, and very systems-oriented.
It also means I do my best work with deep focus and minimal noise, and meeting-heavy days can be especially draining.

If I'm slow to respond, it's usually life or volume — not a lack of care. Sometimes I'm just behind on a long queue of Slack messages.

I really appreciate humans that give each other grace, clarity, and room to be human.

💛 **Final note**

I care a lot about the people I work with, not just the work itself. 

If you're ever stuck, unclear, overwhelmed, or just need a second brain (or un-serious therapy) — reach out. 

— Steph 🌼
